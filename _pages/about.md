I am a third year [ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/index.html) Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University). I've been very fortunate to be a part of [the Geometry Collective](http://geometry.cs.cmu.edu/) and to be advised by [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/). This summer (2023) I am an intern at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/), where I've had the pleasure of working with [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/) and [Qingnan Zhou](https://research.adobe.com/person/qingnan-zhou/).
  
Previously, I graduated from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and a minor in Mathematics. A copy of my CV can be found [here](https://hbaktash.github.io/files/CV%20Hossein_Baktash.pdf).

Research
===
My research interest broadly is in geometry processing and computer graphics. I enjoy learning about [Differential Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry) problems and applying that knowledge to the [discrete domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry).

I used to do [Computational Imaging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9887680); where I got to learn some physics and do physical experiments. Before that, in my undergrads, I worked on some Graph Theory [problems](sss) and statistics.

Misc
=====
I've been a member of the CMU [pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_(cue_sports)) team and club. Back in Tehran, I was lucky to be 
a part of [Sharif University's Mountaineering Club](https://www.instagram.com/hamnavard.sharif/) family.
